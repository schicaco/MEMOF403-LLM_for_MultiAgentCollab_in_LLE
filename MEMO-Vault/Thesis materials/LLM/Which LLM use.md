## Best LLMs for Multi-Agent Collaboration: A Practical Guide

There’s no single “best” LLM for multi-agent collaboration; the choice depends on  
(1) where you want to run it,  
(2) how much latency you can tolerate,  
(3) your budget, and  
(4) how deep you want to customize / fine-tune.

### ▶️ Quick Rule of Thumb

- **Strongest zero-shot (API)**: `GPT-4(o)`, `Claude 3 Opus`  
- **Open-weight + fine-tuning**: `Llama 3-70B`, `Mixtral 8×7B`  
- **Real-time game ticks**: `Mistral 7B v0.2`, `Phi-3-mini (4.2B)`

## 1. Decision Matrix

| Requirement                                                   | Best Fit Models                  | Why / Trade-offs |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Raw reasoning, long context, minimal engineering              | GPT-4(o), Claude 3 Opus          | Best few-shot reasoning, 128k context, easy to prototype, but expensive |
| Open weights, high quality, big GPU budget (2×A100 or better) | Llama 3-70B-Instruct             | Top open-source scores, LoRA/QLoRA-friendly |
| Open weights, MoE efficiency, 1×80 GB or 2×40 GB              | Mixtral 8×7B                     | Mixture of Experts, 2/8 active → efficient |
| Low-latency, laptop/edge deployment                           | Mistral 7B, Phi-3-mini (4.2B)    | Sub-15ms/token on RTX 4090 |
| Offline, smallest footprint                                   | TinyLlama-1.1B, Phi-2            | CPU-capable, limited reasoning |

## 2. Integration Pattern (LLMs + Multi-Agent Game Engine)

Assuming you have an in-game “IPA” (Interaction/Physics API):

**Step 1: Define Agent Roles (System Prompts)**  
- “Scout”, “Builder”, “Strategist”…  
- Include function schemas (JSON/tool format) and role-specific instructions.

**Step 2: Choose Communication Style**  
- `Central Orchestrator`: One LLM calls each agent.  
- `Decentralized Chat`: Agents message each other (CrewAI/Autogen-style).  

**Step 3: Enable Tool Use (API Interaction)**  
- Expose IPA as function-calling or tools.  
- LLM returns structured JSON → engine executes → feedback loop.  

**Step 4 (Optional): Learn from Game Traces**  
- Record `<state, message, action, reward>`  
- Use for:  
  - **Behavior Cloning**: Fine-tune smaller model on good traces  
  - **RLAIF/DPO**: Learn preference for high-reward moves  
- Distill GPT-4 reasoning into small runtime model.

## 3. Open vs Closed Models

| Feature                       | Closed APIs (GPT-4(o), Claude)    | Open Weights (Llama, Mistral) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Best out-of-box performance  | ✔                                 | ✖ May need fine-tune         |
| Long context support         | ✔ 128k tokens                      | ✖ Usually <32k               |
| Self-hosting                 | ✖                                 | ✔                             |
| Fine-tuning                  | ✖ Closed                           | ✔ LoRA/QLoRA possible         |
| Cost at scale                | ✖ Pay per token                    | ✔ Once you own GPU           |
| Real-time control            | ✖ Rate-limited & higher latency    | ✔ Deterministic latency       |

## 4. Practical Recommendations

- **Unlimited budget**: Use GPT-4(o) during training → distill into Llama 3-8B or Phi-3-mini  
- **Academic / Indie with 1×24 GB GPU**: Mixtral 8×7B (4-bit), or Mistral 7B if memory-constrained  
- **On-device (VR, edge, mobile)**: Phi-3-mini (gguf), Mistral 7B-int4 via llama.cpp

## 5. Key Questions to Decide

1. How much context must each agent keep (full match log vs recent turns)?  
2. Real-time constraints? (e.g. need <100ms per tick?)  
3. Do you have GPUs, or rely on APIs only?  
4. Can you embed models (or must weights stay private)?
