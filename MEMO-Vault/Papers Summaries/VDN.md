# Value-Decomposition Networks for Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning

## 1. Problem Addressed

In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), multiple agents aim to optimize a single, shared team reward. The challenge is that each agent:

- Has only partial observability of the environment,
    
- Receives the same joint reward, and
    
- Must learn to act without full knowledge of teammates’ actions or intentions.
    

Standard approaches suffer from:

- The “lazy agent” problem (some agents stop learning to avoid harming others’ progress),
    
- Non-stationarity (teammates’ changing policies alter the learning environment),
    
- Difficulty attributing rewards to individual contributions (credit assignment).
    

Fully centralized methods struggle with scalability and poor credit assignment, while fully independent learners cannot reliably coordinate.

## 2. Proposed Solution: Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN)

The authors introduce a new architecture called the Value-Decomposition Network (VDN), which addresses the credit assignment problem by:

- Learning a decomposition of the global team Q-function into agent-wise value functions:
    
    Q_total ≈ Q₁ + Q₂ + ... + Qₙ
    
- Each agent learns its local Q-function (Q̃ᵢ) from the global reward signal via backpropagation.
    
- At test time, agents act greedily based on their own Q̃ᵢ, supporting decentralized execution.
    

The key idea: although the training is centralized, the learned value functions are individually grounded and can be executed independently.

## 3. Theoretical Concepts

### Q-value Factorization

- Breaks down a complex joint Q-function into a sum of individual Q-values:
    
    Q_joint(s, a₁, ..., aₙ) ≈ ∑ Q̃ᵢ(hᵢ, aᵢ)
    
- This simplification helps agents learn faster and with better coordination.
    

### Centralised Training with Decentralised Execution (CTDE)

- Agents are trained with access to global information (centralised training),
    
- But must act independently based on local observations (decentralised execution).
    

### Agent Invariance

- When agents share weights and differ only through role identifiers, they are said to be “conditionally agent invariant”.
    
- This improves generalization and reduces parameters.

## 4. Experimental Setup

### Environments

Three 2D grid-world tasks were used:

- Switch: agents must coordinate to pass through narrow corridors without collisions.
    
- Fetch: agents alternate picking up and dropping off objects; requires synchronized cycles.
    
- Checkers: agents with asymmetric reward sensitivities must coordinate to collect good items while avoiding bad ones.
    

Agents had very limited visual fields and operated in partially observable settings.

### Agent Types Tested

- Independent agents with no communication
    
- Centralised agents (with full state and joint action space)
    
- VDN agents, with or without:
    
    - Weight sharing
        
    - Role information
        
    - Information channels (communication layers)
        

---

## 5. Results and Insights

- VDN-based agents consistently outperformed both centralised and independent learners.
    
- Weight sharing was helpful, especially in symmetric tasks like Fetch.
    
- Role information improved coordination in asymmetric roles (e.g., Checkers).
    
- Information channels helped, but increased training complexity.
    
- VDNs solved the lazy agent problem and improved sample efficiency.
    

The model learned to decompose the team Q-function into meaningful agent-specific components that supported coordination, even in tasks with sparse or delayed rewards.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Work

- Value-Decomposition Networks are a practical and scalable approach to cooperative MARL.
    
- They outperform baseline architectures on complex coordination tasks.
    
- VDNs allow credit assignment to be learned from joint reward signals without hand-designed shaping.
    
- The authors suggest future work should:
    
    - Scale VDNs to larger agent teams,
        
    - Explore nonlinear decompositions (e.g., monotonic mixing like QMIX),
        
    - Combine VDNs with richer communication mechanisms.
