# LLM-based agent for multi-agent collaboration

In the last few ears, the use of LLM for multi-agent collaboration has emerge  

## LLM-Collab: A Framework for Enhancing Task Planning via Chain-of-Thought and Multi-Agent Collaboration

_LLM-Collab_, a framework designed to enhance task planning by combining the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and multi-agent collaboration. While LLMs excel at natural language understanding and problem decomposition, they struggle with execution, tool use, and adaptability in complex scenarios. LLM-Collab addresses these limitations by orchestrating two distinct agents — an analyst and an executor — who work together to analyze problems, choose external tools, and iteratively refine solutions.

Prompts are carefully crafted using few-shot examples, step-by-step rationale, and instructions that guide each agent’s behavior. The system is designed to avoid infinite loops during task refinement by enforcing limits on iteration count and execution time.

## Scaling Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration

This work investigates how collaboration among LLM-based agents evolves as team size increases, tasks become more complex, and model capabilities vary. The primary objective is to understand the emergent behaviors, coordination strategies, and cooperative dynamics that arise when multiple LLM agents are cooperating to resolve tasks that demand advanced reasoning and coordination.

## Simulating Classroom Education with LLM-Empowered Agents

The paper explores the potential of simulating classroom environments using LLM-based agents to better understand social learning dynamics and to develop scalable, controllable education simulations. Rather than using LLMs just as tutors or students in isolation, the authors simulate full classroom interactions with multiple autonomous agents taking on roles such as students, teachers, and observers.
